# Minecraft Server Utilities
MCSU is a tool to make server creation quick and easy made in python. At the moment, it can only create paper servers. The goal in the end is to be able to manage servers.

 # Planned Features
I plan to add some of these features. Some may be cut, but I will try to add as many of these as possible.

- Creating fabric, forge, neoforge, quilt and vannilla servers
- Whitelist sharing
- Plugin/Mod manager for searching, downloading and adding plugins to a server. (I might make this a seperate tool)
- Server Manager for managing and starting servers.
